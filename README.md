# C ML

## Purpose

This project is an implementation of a classical neural network in plain C.

## Requirements

- `gcc`

## Build Instructions

Use `./scripts/dbuild.sh` and `./scripts/build/drun.sh` to run the debug version
and `./scripts/rbuild.sh` and `./scripts/rrun.sh` for the release version.

## Current Status

Machine learning seems to be working, but the algorithm of when to stop and how
to vary learning rate needs to be tweaked. Works reasonably well, though.
